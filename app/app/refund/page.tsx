      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Refund Policy applies to all products and services provided through
        the Papa Alai Automatic platform ("Service", "we", "us", or "our").
      </p>

      <h2>1. Digital Products</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the nature of digital products (including but not limited to software,
        automation tools, templates, digital files, AI workflows, and downloadable content),
        all sales are considered final once access has been granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not offer refunds for digital products unless explicitly stated otherwise
        on the product sales page.
      </p>

      <h2>2. SaaS Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        Subscription-based services are billed in advance on a recurring basis
        (monthly or annually, depending on the selected plan).
      </p>
      <p>
        You may cancel your subscription at any time. Upon cancellation,
        you will retain access to the Service until the end of the current billing period.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not provide prorated refunds for unused time in a billing cycle.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Exceptional Cases</h2>
      <p>
        Refunds may be considered in exceptional circumstances, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Duplicate charges</li>
        <li>Technical issues preventing access to the Service that cannot be resolved</li>
        <li>Charges made in error</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All refund requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and are not guaranteed.
      </p>
