      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Refund Policy applies to all products and services provided through the Papa Alai Automatic platform
        (“Service”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
      </p>

      <h2>1. Digital Products (Downloads & Access)</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the nature of digital products (including software, automation tools, templates, downloadable files,
        AI workflows, and access to digital content), all sales are generally final once access has been granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Access granted” may include (but is not limited to) account activation, login access, file download access,
        license key delivery, or providing a private link/invite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refunds for digital products are not provided unless explicitly stated on the product sales page or required by law.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        If you purchase a subscription, you may cancel at any time. Your subscription will remain active until the end
        of the current billing period. We generally do not provide refunds for the current billing period once it has started,
        except where required by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Duplicate Charges / Billing Errors</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe you were charged incorrectly (for example, duplicate charges), please contact us. If confirmed,
        we will correct the error and issue an appropriate refund or adjustment.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Chargebacks</h2>
      <p>
        Please contact us first before initiating a chargeback. If a chargeback is initiated without contacting us,
        we reserve the right to suspend access to the Service while the dispute is investigated.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Contact</h2>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        We typically respond within <strong>48 hours</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Service after updates means you accept
        the revised policy.
