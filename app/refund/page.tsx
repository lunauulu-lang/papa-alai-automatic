      <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Refund Policy applies to all products and services provided through the Papa Alai Automatic platform (“Service”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).
      </p>

      <h2>1. Digital Products</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the nature of digital products (including software, automation tools, templates, downloadable files, AI workflows, and access to digital content),
        all sales are considered final once access has been granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not offer refunds for digital products unless explicitly stated otherwise on the product sales page.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
      <p>
        If you purchase a subscription, you may cancel at any time. Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing period.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subscription fees already paid are generally non-refundable, except where required by applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Chargebacks</h2>
      <p>
        If you initiate a chargeback without contacting us first, we reserve the right to suspend your access to the Service while the dispute is investigated.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Questions about refunds or billing: <a href="mailto:support@alaibek.com">support@alaibek.com</a>
      </p>

      <h2>5. Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Service after updates means you accept the revised policy.
